ResultSet

ResultSet Cursor

each instance of ResultSet has an in-memory cursor

the starting cursor position is before the first row of data

the most common operation is to move froward from row to row

	ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM states");
	while (rs.next()) {
		String columnValue = rs.getString("columnName");
		//or
		String columnValue = rs.getString(column position);
		System.out.println(columnValue);
	}
